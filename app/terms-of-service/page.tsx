                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Termination of Services by ForkHR</strong>. ForkHR has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Services, including Mobile Ordering, provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in ForkHR’s sole

                        <br/><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong>. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Platform, to any products sold or distributed through the Platform, or to any aspect of your
                        relationship with ForkHR, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (b) you or ForkHR may seek equitable relief in court for
                        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests
                        for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute
                        or claim or request for relief to Fork Workforce Inc., 241 Centre St., 3rd Fl., New York, NY 10013, Attn: Legal Department, with a copy to legal@forkhr.com. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
                        involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at&nbsp;
                        <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"
                        target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at&nbsp;
                        <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"
                        target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS’s rules are also available at&nbsp;
                        <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>&nbsp;or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing
                        and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, ForkHR will pay them for you. In addition, ForkHR will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than
                        $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>
                    <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                        court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong>. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
                        formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ForkHR. The arbitration
                        proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
                        monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
                        of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
                        would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>. YOU AND ForkHR HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and ForkHR are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief
                        shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the section entitled “Application of Arbitration Agreement” above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and
                        must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong>. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL
                        RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>
                    <p>If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal
                        Courts located in the State of New York. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to support@forkhr.com within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this
                        Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;Your notice must include your name and address, your ForkHR username (if any), the email address you used to set up your ForkHR account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
                        Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may
                        enter in the future, with us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Severability</strong>. Except as provided in the section entitled “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief”, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part
                        or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Survival of Agreement</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with ForkHR.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br/><strong>Modification</strong>. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if ForkHR makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming
                        effective by writing ForkHR at&nbsp;
